\begin{abstract}
		This report, and the code included on the CD attached to it, is the final product produced for the final project as an IT engineer at the Technical University of Denmark, Ballerup Campus.
		
		The purpose of the project is to demonstrate my ability to analyse, design and implement a solution to the problem case delivered to me by P/F Looknorth.
		
		The problem to be solved is to make a solution so that the production machines operate at the same good level, but stabilising the oil consumption.
